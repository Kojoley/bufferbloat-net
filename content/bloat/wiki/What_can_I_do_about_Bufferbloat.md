# What Can I Do About Bufferbloat?

Bufferbloat is high latency (or lag) that occurs when there's other
traffic on your network.
This means that your network isn't responsive under normal working conditions.
It's wasting your time.
Here's what you can do:

**1. Measure the Bufferbloat:**
Use the [Waveform Bufferbloat Test](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat)
to measure the latency under load (this is a good measure of responsiveness).
If the test shows a letter grade worse than a B, you probably have bufferbloat.
Most likely, the device at your bottleneck link
(usually your router) is letting bulk traffic (uploads/downloads) interfere with
(and delay) your time-sensitive traffic (gaming, video calls, Facetime, etc.)
For more details about testing,
read the [Tests for Bufferbloat](./Tests_for_Bufferbloat.md) page.

**2. Possible Solutions:** There are lots of ways to throw time or money at this problem.
Most won't work.

* Your ISP would love to sell you a faster connection, but link speed isn't the problem -
it's your router buffering more data than necessary.
* Buying an expensive router (even one for "gaming") won't necessarily help,
since many commercial, off-the-shelf router manufacturers are clueless about Bufferbloat.
* Twiddling the router's QoS might make a difference,
[but it's a hassle, and only helps a bit.](More_about_Bufferbloat#what-s-wrong-with-simply-configuring-qos)
* Instead...

**3. Take Control of Your Network:**
No one else (not your router manufacturer,
nor most ISPs) have as strong an incentive to fix it.
Once you do, the network will stay fixed for all time, 
and you can adapt to changing practices at your ISP or other vendors.

You need to find a router vendor that "understands"
latency/responsiveness/bufferbloat,
and has updated the firmware to use one of the
Smart Queue Management algorithms such as
cake, fq_codel, PIE, or others. 
Here are some options, from easy to harder:

- **Enable SQM settings** if your router already has them.

First, measure the link speed _without_ SQM
(say, using [Waveform](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat))
then turn on SQM and measure again while observing the latency measurements.
Start with the no-SQM up and down speed settings keep adjusting and measuring
until the latency remains low while achieving good speeds.
See, for example, this description of a [tuning session.](Getting_SQM_Running_Right)

- **Install an off-the-shelf router with SQM** Several commercial router vendors have a clue. 
    Here is a list of those we have found:
    * [IQrouter](http://evenroute.com) provides a good setup wizard for
    configuring SQM, and automatically tunes its settings. 
    IQrouter v3 is good to about 350 mbps. (Version 2 was good for 200-250 mbps.)
    * [Ubiquiti gear](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/220716608-EdgeRouter-Advanced-queue-CLI-examples) has fq_codel settings. 
    People say its EdgeRouter will handle over 400 mbps.
    * The [eero mesh routers](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000709886-What-is-eero-Labs-)
"optimize for conferencing and gaming" (their term for SQM.)
Their third generation devices
[support SQM at speeds up to a gigabit/second.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/qxbkcl/66_is_out/hl9nw1m/)
    * All [Comcast/Xfinity](https://comcast.net)
DOCSIS 3.1 RDK-B-based gateway models have now been updated
with DOCSIS-PIE AQM and all are achieving dramatically
improved working latency.
(See Footnote 59 of
[_Improving Latency with Active Queue Management (AQM) During COVID-19_](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2107/2107.13968.pdf)
for model numbers.)
    * Many other mesh router vendors claim to solve bufferbloat.
    Check their spec's or ask them about latency.
    * [Untangle NG Firewall](https://wiki.untangle.com/index.php/Bufferbloat) has fq_codel settings.
    * [ipfire.org](https://wiki.ipfire.org/configuration/services/qos) has fq_codel settings.
    * [pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/) and [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)
have fq\_codel and fq\_PIE settings, courtesy of FreeBSD and
[ipfw/dummynet](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+13.0-RELEASE+and+Ports)
    

-  **Upgrade your current router.**
Install [OpenWrt firmware](https://OpenWrt.org) (version 22.03, 21.02, 19.07, or 18.06).
The [Smart Queue Management guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/traffic-shaping/sqm)
tells how to configure the *luci-app-sqm* package.
Or install suitable [DD-WRT](https://www.dd-wrt.com),
[Gargoyle](https://www.gargoyle-router.com) or
[Tomato](https://freshtomato.org) firmware, all of which support some kind
of queue management based on FQ-CoDel and/or Cake.

-  **Call your router vendor's support line**
if none of the above are possible.
You have the information from the latency tests.
Mention that the ping times get really high when someone is up/downloading
files, and that it really hurts your network performance.
Ask if they're working on the problem.
Ask when they're going to release a firmware update that solves it.

Your network's responsiveness is in _your_ hands...
